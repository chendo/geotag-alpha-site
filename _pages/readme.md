Welcome to Geotag Alpha's early stage testing (alpha). Please report any issues to chendo[at]sproutcube.com.

## Preparing your camera

Geotag Alpha requires your camera's Bluetooth functionality as well as "Location Information Linkage" to be enabled.

Please see [Sony's support page](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/articles/00196927) for more information on how to do this for your camera.
