# Privacy Policy

**Summary:** We collect telemetry and error data to improve the app, which does not contain any PII unless you choose to include it. No location data is ever sent anywhere, apart from to your connected cameras. We will never sell your data.

## Telemetry and error data

Geotag Alpha uses Sentry to collect error and telemetry data, which is sent to a self-hosted Sentry instance located in Australia.

Geotag Alpha also uses Apple's MetricKit system to collect app metrics.
