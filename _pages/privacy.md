# Privacy Policy

**Summary:** We collect telemetry and error data to improve the app, which does not contain any PII unless you choose to include it. No location data is ever sent anywhere, apart from to your connected cameras. We will never sell your data.

## Telemetry and error data

Geotag Alpha sends crash, error, and basic telemetry data to Apple and Sentry (EU).
