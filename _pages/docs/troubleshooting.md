## Unable to pair

Try removing the existing pairing on both the camera and the iPhone, then try repairing.

On camera: `Network` -> `Bluetooth` -> `Managed Paired Device` -> `Delete iPhone`

On iPhone: `Settings` -> `Bluetooth` -> `Tap the (i) next to your camera` -> `Forget this Device`

Then turn camera off and on again, and try repairing with the app.
